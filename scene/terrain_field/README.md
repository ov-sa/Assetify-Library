##### ━ Author(s): [Aviril](https://github.com/Aviril)

**Terrain Field** is a simple vast low-poly terrain (**~15k Poly**) showcasing how to achieve higher poly results without adding more polygons to your base model & simplifying blending methodology via **Control & Bump maps**. It also further more demonstrates how you can achieve greater draw-distance for your terrains w/o any LODs (**400 Chunks**). Thus simulating open-world scenes efficiently.
